## Intro

# Simple-App

**Simple-App** is a lightweight backend application developed using NestJS, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL. The project provides essential user management features, including authentication, user statistics, and profile management.

## Features

### Authentication

- **Sign Up & Login:**
  - **Email & Password:** Users can sign up and log in using their email and a user-defined password. Upon registration, the user will receive an email verification link.
  - **Google OAuth:** Users can sign up and log in using their Google account, bypassing the need for email verification.
  - **Facebook OAuth:** Users can sign up and log in using their Facebook account, also bypassing email verification.

### Dashboard

Once logged in, users are redirected to a personalized dashboard where they can access the following:

- **User Profile:**

  - View their username and email.

- **User List:**

  - View a list of all users registered in the application, with the following details for each user:
    - **Sign-Up Timestamp:** The date and time when the user signed up.
    - **Login Count:** The number of times the user has logged in.
    - **Logout Timestamp:** The last time the user logged out.

- **User Statistics:**
  - **Total Registered Users:** The total number of users who have signed up.
  - **Active Sessions Today:** The total number of users with active sessions today.
  - **Average Active Sessions (Last 7 Days):** The average number of users with active sessions over the last 7 days.

### Profile Management

- **Resend Email Verification Link**
- **Reset Password:** Users can reset their password using the provided form. They need to input their old password, new password, and confirm the new password.
- **Update Username:** Users can change their username.
- **Logout:** Users can securely log out from the application.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.x LTS version
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) package manager
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download) database

## Installation

### Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dikiamust/simple-app-be

cd simple-app-be
```

### Environment Variables

You can see it in the .env.example file

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

If you want to add a new variable, don't forget to update the [nest.config file](src/configs/nest.config.ts). So, you will get the type hint when you want to use it.

More information about configuration file: [docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

### Install Depedencies

```sh
yarn # or yarn install
```

### Available Scripts

#### Run Project

- Run development server

  ```sh
  yarn start:dev
  ```

- Build for production

  ```sh
